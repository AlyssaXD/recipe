            spread the batter in the ring, and remove because you must work quickly to shape these cookies, bake just 3 at a time.

            Lay a fortune in the lower middle of the cookie, and fold in half to make a semi-circle. Bend the edges up toward each other to make a crescent.
            Drag the crease across the rim of a small measuring cup, with the ends facing down. Cool in mini muffin tins to hold a shape until crisp.</td>
